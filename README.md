# The Comprehensive Python Guide

Welcome to the Comprehensive Python Guide! In this guide, I will explain the basics of Python,
and take you far beyond them. Here is what you will need:

- Python 3.7 or later installed
- Pip, Python's package manager, installed

If these aren't installed, read section 0. Otherwise, feel free to skip straight to section 1!

# 0:  Installing Python and Pip

## 0.1:  Installing Python and Pip on Windows

### 0.1.1 Installing from Python.org

In your favorite web browser, go to [the Python home page](https://python.org) and click the menu 
bar. You will see a section called "Downloads". Click on Windows under that section, and click 
"Latest Python 3 release". Scroll down to the files section, then download the Windows Installer
that says it is 64-bit. When it is downloaded, run the installer. Feel free to choose whatever 
options you want in the installer, but ensure that you install pip alongside Python. Congratulations,
you just installed Python!

### 0.1.2 Installing from Scoop

Scoop is a package manager for Windows. To install with scoop, simply open a terminal and type
`scoop install python`. Once it is installed, you're done. Congratulations, you just installed Python!

## 0.2 Installing Python and Pip on MacOs

### 0.2.1 Installing from Python.org

Follow the same steps as Windows, but instead choose one of the MacOs installers, depending on what 
CPU you have in your system.

Brew is a package manager for MacOs. To install with Brew, open a terminal and type `brew install python3`. Congratulations, you just installed Python!

Python is installed by default on most ditributions. If you don't have it, use your system package manager to install it.

# 1 Hello World

In this section, I will explain how to write a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python.

## 1.1 Opening Python in your terminal

First, we need to open a terminal. On windows, press Win+R, and type "cmd". On MacOs, open the launchpad and click "Terminal". On Linux, open your favorite terminal emulator. Then in your terminal,
type `python3`. 

## 1.2 Programming the Hello World Program

After typing `python3`, you should see something like this: ```
Python 3.9.5 (tags/v3.9.5:0a7dcbd, May  3 2021, 17:27:52) [MSC v.1928 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
